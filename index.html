                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        The world of music is ever growing and evolving, and we’re not just talking about sound trends. With the consistent introduction of varying revenue streams and distribution channels, the opportunity for profit grows, but so does the complexity. That’s where we come in.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Television, Film, &amp; Theatre</h2>
                    <p>
                        The way people consume entertainment is constantly in flux, so the laws must adapt quickly. Harris Ingram strives to anticipate these changes so you can focus more on creating the performance of a lifetime.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Digital Media &amp; Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        The internet, software, and technology are so pervasive that we can’t remember having ever lived without them. They make our lives simpler, but behind the curtain are fluctuating challenges in protection and monetization—challenges that our firm stays two steps ahead of.

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>Art Litigation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Demystifying art law is in itself a creative practice. It requires finesse, strategic structuring, and in many ways, empathy. At the end of the day, art and its worth are profoundly personal. That’s why we advise mediation or arbitration before stepping into litigation.

                    <h2>Business Strategy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The startup and small business marketplace is still a new and fierce frontier that requires legal advice from attorneys who are deeply entrenched in the particularities of venture financing. Our firm gives you an holistic approach, so your company can get the best competitive advantage.

                    <h2>Fashion, Apparel &amp; Textile Law</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fashion law is a little bit like the Wild West. There’s a lot of potential, but the rules can seem convoluted and vague at best. Protecting a brand or even a single design involves intellectual property, copyrights, trademarks, and patents.
