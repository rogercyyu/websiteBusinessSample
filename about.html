                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>
                        Angeline Harris and Spencer Ingram met while working at Lee, Wooden &amp; Ziegler LLP, one of the most sought-after corporate firms in the country. Angeline focused on Arts &amp; Entertainment and Spencer specialized in Digital Media &amp; Technology. We found that their individual fields complemented each other’s in surprising, and what turned out to be inseparable, ways. Technology was changing the arts and vice versa. This made them eager to cultivate their own practice, one that would effectively intersect their expertise with their respective interests. They believe that what wins a case and what makes a creative business thrive is the passion that drives it. Choosing to specialize in a field means that you are completely devoted to it; that you will protect it as if it were your own. That is the energy that sets them apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Harris Ingram opened its doors in 2003. Since then, they've facilitated the success of artists like Aurora Falls and Nayantara Kani along with bike company HydroCycle and established tech enterprise Tap Unlimited. In 2011, they brought on Associate Isabel Sonam to work with fashion companies, photographers, and fine artists. She brings an exceptional level of enthusiasm, dedication, and nuanced perspective that makes their firm the holistic solution for creative clients.

                            From working at the prestigious Lee, Wooden &amp; Ziegler LLP to opening her own practice in 2001, Angeline has represented Arts &amp; Entertainment clients large and small for nearly 20 years.

Practicing since the first internet boom, Angeline has hands-on experience with how technology affects the creative industry. Staying ahead of the law’s frequent changes is Angeline’s sixth sense.
